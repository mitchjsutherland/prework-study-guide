# <Mitch's Pre Work Guide>

## Description

This study guide was created as the prework to the beginning of my web development journey!

It contains notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. 

NOTE - I seem to have some issues with multiple GitHub accounts which is showing on the pre-work repository. This is a reminder to query this with a tutor.

## Usage

Each section contains notes specific to that area of studying. This guide can be used continuously to update key learning points and serve as a one-page web bible for revision.


## Credits

As mentioned above, I will need to address the issue of multiple contributors on my repository! I have attempted to address this through the terminal by changing the git config user.email - however when I enter git --list to show my profile settings, there are 2 different email addresses showing.
